A demo I've written in 2006,
I'm finally putting the sources on github.
Original README file below : 

----------------------------------------------------
le k.

florent.lobstre (final version)

code.design.music : me

i'm happy this demo saw the day, i truly didn't expected it at first.
this demo should work under windows, linux (intel) and mac osx (power pc & intel : universal binaries \o/)
the windows version has all required dll files
the osx version embeds the required sdl frameworks (sdl, sdl_ttf, sdl_mixer)
the linux version requires installation of sdl, sdl_ttf, sdl_mixer, opengl & libsdtc++

source is released under the gpl, it won't compile out of the box, cause it requires boost and glew
the executable and data files are released under the creative commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 

this demo was started on a powerpc g4 mac mini and finished at the party place on a pc linux-ubuntu laptop and final version was made on the mac mini..
it is slightly different from the party version, has less geometry, but more dense one..

command lines switches : 
-fullscreen
-windowed
-640
-800
-1024
-1280
-1600

inspiration : 
contextfree : http://www.contextfreeart.org/ (i prototyped the main effect with it)
jari pitkänen's soundtracks (the ballet dancer, vorticity, golem arise..)
kaija saariaho (adriana mater, colors shown during the opera)
halcyon (the demo the jury i took part in disqualified)
dino buzzati (the k. novel)

thanx to knos / tpolm for his help and the cokus.c file..
thanx to pan / spinning kids for his debugging help at the party place..

love:
